[details]Hey guys (and girls)! I’m Thomas and I’m from the mighty Upper Hutt. I study at Vic doing a bachelors of Commerce in Accounting and Economics – but I’m really a gamer and computer guy at heart.

I enjoy gaming in my spare time – as you can probably guess. Some of those games include Osu!, DOTA2, CS:GO and CS:S to name a few. I remember when my family first got a Playstation One (just called a Playstation back then) – I was fascinated with the way that games worked and I really enjoyed playing those games. Since then, I’ve gone from PS1 an expensive desktop and everything in between.I’ve had heaps of awesome experiences along the way and I’ve made HEAPS of awesome mates inside and outside of New Zealand.

Like I’ve said, I enjoy gaming and the way that gaming works and how people enjoy them, being with APoG is pretty much a dream come true – not only can I play games, but I get to help organise awesome gaming events. Being able to help out with events is something that I’ve always wanted to do. What I love is to be able to bring gaming communities together.

What I really want to achieve is to create a massive and down-to-earth gaming community, I always keep in mind that it’s thanks to you, the gamers, that we can do what we do and I want to always please you guys![/details]
