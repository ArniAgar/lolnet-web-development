Hey guys (and girls)! I'm Thomas and I'm from the mighty Upper Hutt. I study at Vic doing a bachelors of Commerce in Accounting and Economics - but I'm really a gamer and computer guy at heart.

I enjoy gaming in my spare time - as you can probably guess. Some of those games include Osu!, DOTA2, CS:GO and CS:S to name a few. I remember when my family first got a Playstation One (just called a Playstation back then) - I was fascinated with the way that games worked and I really enjoyed playing those games. Since then, I've gone from PS1 an expensive desktop and everything in between.I've had heaps of awesome experiences along the way and I've made HEAPS of awesome mates inside and outside of New Zealand.

Like I've said, I enjoy gaming and the way that gaming works and how people enjoy them. During 2014 and 2015 I've been able to work closely with Aspect of Gaming, Leaping Tiger, and Lolnet - all of which are fantastic gaming organisations in New Zealand and I've loved being able to help them achieve their goals.

What I really want to achieve is to create a massive and down-to-earth gaming community, I always keep in mind that it's thanks to you, the gamers, that we can do what we do and I want to make sure you're all happy! :D
