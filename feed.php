Hello,<br />I made a mistake and now only admins have access to fix it.<br />I did /t pass marko23223 (my username), which made me lose all of my town access. My town resident never gets online, so he can't leave. (I will update if fixed) Then after i did /t pass i left, because i thought i kicked everyone from my town, but x_Mariolink_x (not sure about the name) is now the only resident. I would like this to be fixed by:<br />a) kicking the resident<br />b) deleting the town (but please consider I am in a different timezone so I will get raided overnight if it's not protected. I live in Europe +01:00.)<br />Thank you,<br />Marko.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.lolnet.co.nz/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=32297">marko23223</a> — 11 May 2015, 03:25</p><hr />

Hi there, I'm Vindictator1972, I would very much like to be a User Assistant for Lolnet as I like to help people out on the server and there is a slightly better chance people might actually listen to me when helping them as the name will stand out from the sea of white.<br /><br />I don't believe I should be a User Assistant as I don't feel entitled to the spot just for being somewhat knowledgeable on Minecraft and a good amount of mods from a few years of experience.<br /><br />In the past I did some work on a friends Minecraft server that was open to the Public a few years ago but that server got shut down as he could no longer afford to pay for it and there was little traffic for the most part.<br />I have also owned a server or 2 over the years for Minecraft but they didn't last long for the same reason as my friends.<br />I have also Owned my own TF2 server for about a year but costs were too high.<br />(All of the Above servers where done through a hosting service.)<br /><br />Personally I have never used Prism, CoreProtect, ReportRTS etc, but I am always willing to learn if needed.<br />I don't really have any non minecraft skills other than some decent TF2 server Stuff.<br /><br />On the server I have helped a few people who were new to some mods and learnt some things from others along the way, I usually do my best to resolve issues people have as I don't really like to see a wall of insulting text.<br />Some times I haven't really been a good little player have been the few times I may have started arguments with people over trivial things or miscommunications.<br /><br />I cant really think of any ways that I personally could improve Lolnet as its a really awesome and fun place to chill and the staff are a lot better than a previous server I played on (Harassed by the co-owner and their head admin (Just for how I talked on there), the owner was a chill dude though.)<br /><br />I have a Microphone and headphones and have used Mumble a few times in the past, not much but I did have the Lolnet mumble Bookmarked before a Hard drive failure.<br /><br />That looks to be about Everything, Thank-you to whoever reads this for your Considerations.<br />-----Vindictator1972<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.lolnet.co.nz/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=32521">VINDICTATOR1972</a> — 02 May 2015, 14:40</p><hr />
