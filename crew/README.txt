	HOW TO USE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions on handling index.txt to add staff.

Crew/Staff listing is written in a custom BB code format.
It must follow this format to work;
[crew]
[name] NAME IN HERE [/name]
[position] POSITION IN HERE [/position]
[details] BLURB IN HERE [/details]
[/crew]

This format must be followed for each person and added directly after the previous.
The [crew] tag, and all others, must be closed.

[crew]
[name] NAME IN HERE [/name]
[position] POSITION IN HERE [/position]
[details] BLURB IN HERE [/details]
[/crew]
[crew]
[name] NAME IN HERE [/name]
[position] POSITION IN HERE [/position]
[details] BLURB IN HERE [/details]
[/crew]

To get an image applied, you must save an image in the crew folder (/img/crew/) and
name it as [name].jpg - that is the name of the person which will be used inside the
[name] tag WITHOUT any spaces followed by .jpg. No other file extension is supported.
